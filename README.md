## Description
This project will allow users to build their own or pick one of the already existing vehicles to do multiple features for that vehicle, Accelerate, Decelerate, Tow, Reverse, Start, and Wheelie (only for motorbikes).

## Installation

First thing you're going to want to do is make sure you have Node.js installed, after thats installed you're going to want to click the code button and download the zip file. Extract the zip and open the folder in your terminal type "cd Develop" twice to get to the specific folder and type "npm i". If you need a walkthrough on how to install and use the program just click [Me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AttNIxsF5dc)


## Usage

When the folder is open in the terminal and you already typed "npm i" you have to type "npm run start" then it will open the program and then you can start answering the questions and build your vehicle!!
